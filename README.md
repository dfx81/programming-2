Source for Programming 2 Exercises

NOTE: Don't copy my codes. Some of what I've done
are bad coding style that shouldn't be followed
(ex. missing imports) and I'm pretty sure the comments
are too much (I prefer comments explaining what purpose
a block of code do instead). Most of what I've done are
pure experimentation to test what Java allows and didn't
allow me to do as a programmer.

Tl;Dr: Don't straight up copy pasting my codes
